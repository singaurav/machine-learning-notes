\title{THE PERCEPTRON}
\date{}
\maketitle

The perceptron is a learning algorithm for binary classification of real valued vectors. 

\section{Introduction}

The perceptron binary classifier can be thought of as the following function,

\begin{align*}
	f(\boldsymbol{x}) = \left\{                       
	\begin{array}{ll}                                 
	1\ \text{if}\ \boldsymbol{w}^T \boldsymbol{x} > 0 \\
	0\ \text{otherwise}                               \\
	\end{array}                                       
	\right.                                           
\end{align*}

The vector $\boldsymbol{w}$ is learned from training data as usual. The algorithm for learning the same is presented in the next section.
