\title{HIDDEN MARKOV MODELS}
\date{}
\maketitle

Hidden Markov Models(HMMs) are statistical tools to model sequential observations with the assumption that states of the system generating them follow a Markov process but these states are unobservable/hidden. However, an observation at any point is related to the underlying hidden state the system is in at that point.
